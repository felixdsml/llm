Since the question asks for the total over the past week, we need to consider seven days. Here's how we can formulate the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(daily_distance) AS total_distance_traveled\nFROM london_buses\nWHERE date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND CURDATE();\n```\nThis query uses the `SUM` function to add up the `daily_distance` values and filters the data using the `WHERE` clause to only consider records from the past week.",
    sql="Here's the solution for the given SQL prompt:\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(f.daily_distance) AS total_distance FROM london_buses lb \nJOIN (\n    SELECT bus_id, SUM(daily_distance) AS daily_total \n    FROM london_buses \n    GROUP BY bus_id\n) f ON lb.bus_id = f.bus_id;\n```\nThis query first calculates the daily distance traveled for each bus using a subquery and then sums them up to provide the total distance traveled for all buses in the London transit system."

    rationale="Here are the answers to the SQL queries you provided and the reasoning behind them:\n\n1. The given query aims to retrieve data from two tables, 'garments' and 'fabrics', based on certain conditions. It joins these tables using the fabric ID and filters the results to include only rows where the sustainability score of the fabric is above 70 and the garment's production date is after January 1st, 2023. The query selects all columns from the 'garments' table for the final output.\n\n2.

It then groups the results by the founding year to provide an annual count of companies founded by immigrants. \n\nNow, for your second prompt, here's the solution to list all suppliers who provide products to the 'Organic"

    rationale="To calculate the percentage of total humanitarian aid spent on education for each world region, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Sum up the total amount of humanitarian aid for each region.\n2. Calculate the total amount spent on education worldwide by summing up the 'amount' column for records where the 'category' is 'Education'.\n3. Divide the total education expenditure by the respective total aid for each region and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nHere's the SQL query that implements these steps:\n```sql\nSELECT \n    region,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN category = 'Education' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) / SUM(amount) * 100 AS education_percentage\nFROM humanitarian",
